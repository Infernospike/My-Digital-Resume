## Biography
Hi, I am a senior computer engineer from Roswell, Georgia. My interests in computer engineering are FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Arrays), Digital Design, Embedded Systems, and Storage Systems. I have work experience working with Western Digital, where I was a system integration test engineer CO-OP, where I worked with WD customers to test firmware and storage systems with WD hard drives alongside and with customers' systems. I also have research experience where I tested the comparison of Virtual Machines(VM) and Edge devices by comparing data throughput and latency of data streams using the real-time data stream software Apache Storm test real-time data stream processing.
