    <h3> Work Experience</h3>
    <p><strong>NSF REU Undergraduate Research Assistant</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted comprehensive performance comparisons between Raspberry Pis and virtual machines(VMs) to evaluate their efficiency in real-time data processing.</li>
        <li>Utilized Apache Storm and Riot-Bench for testing, deploying them via Docker and managing resources with Kubernetes.</li>
        <li>Measured throughput and latency to assess the advantages of edge devices like the Raspberry Pi over cloud-based VMs.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p><strong>System Integration Test Engineer Co-op</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifying the compatibility of WD storage drives in enterprise customer system environments.</li>
        <li>In charge of setting up client systems for testing, then keeping an eye on and evaluating system
        logs, bus signals, drive logs, and other data to ascertain the testâ€™s progress. After that, issues are
        identified, examined, and recorded as they arise</li>
        <li>Tasked with automating test scripts and procedures using Python and Bash to improve test
        runtime.</li>
        <li>Implemented a backup server with raid to back up test scripts and test data. I also implemented
        an NTP server for accurate time when running tests and created startup scripts to give instant
        NTP functionality.</li>
